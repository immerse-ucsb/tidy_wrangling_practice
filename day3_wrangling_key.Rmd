Tour of R project:
 
- So far, just a file with a .Rproj extension.  This file indicates "home base" for this project - the root directory.  
- If we move this project directory somewhere else on our hard drive, that .Rproj goes with it.  
- We can use that to our advantage to ensure all file paths are coded relative to that file.
- The alternative (absolute file paths) tend to point to your specific computer's name and directory system, which will not match anyone else's.

Tour of R Markdown:

- Markdown chunks: 
    - easily format text using shortcuts to HTML tags.
    - These chunks are useful to write notes, comments, and explanations about what you are intending to do with your code.  
- code chunks:
    - shaded differently for ease of spotting them
    - start with a "fence" - three backticks, then a curly-brace header with info about the chunk, including language, label, and chunk options.
    - write all your R code - objects will stay in memory even if you leave this chunk and go to another.
    - end with another fence.
    - can type manually, or shortcuts or menu.

Let's load some packages!  Note: not a bad idea to do in setup chunk, but make sure to set up code chunk headers correctly!

```{r load packages}
library(tidyverse) ### dialect of R - cleans up and standardizes a lot of wrangling and data vis
library(here) ### helps with creating relative pathways relative to .Rproj
library(palmerpenguins) ### some data we'll explore
library(poLCA) ### LCA package with some more data we'll use
```

At this point, knit the document to create a .html - note the warnings and errors - go back and adjust the setup chunk to avoid this.

## Tidyverse overview

### what is `tidyverse`?
The `tidyverse` package is a metapackage containing multiple other packages that have various uses for data wrangling, analysis, and visualization.  The main ones we care about are:

- `readr` - fast and efficient reading in of data from CSVs and other tabular formats
- `dplyr` - managing, modifying, and working with data frames - 95% of our data wrangling toolbox
- `tidyr` - swapping between tabular formats - wide vs. long
- `ggplot2` - data visualization
- `forcats` - working with categorical variables in dataframes

Others you may be interested in:

- `stringr` - working with string/character data
- `purrr` - iteration
- `lubridate` - working with date formatted data
- `tidymodels` - consistent modeling across multiple model types

Base R is totally fine too, but the syntax is often idiosyncratic and/or hard to interpret.  The `tidyverse` packages were designed to smooth out inconsistencies, improve readability, and in many cases boost performance.  A good data scientist would want to be proficient in both dialects (and maybe `data.table`) as well as other languages.

### Tidy data principles

- Each variable forms a column.
- Each observation forms a row.
- Each type of observational unit forms a table

counter examples:

- Column headers are values, not variable names.
- Multiple variables are stored in one column.
- Variables are stored in both rows and columns.
- Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.
- A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.

### Tidy wrangling in R

- Dataframe as main data type - columns are vectors of a particular class
- `mutate`, `filter`, `select`, `group_by`/`summarize` are the key dplyr functions in a data wrangling workflow
- Pipe operator `%>%` (or `|>` now native to R) for communicating flow - also vertical organization, spacing, etc to make it easy to read
- `pivot_wider` and `pivot_longer` (older: `spread` and `gather`) are key `tidyr` functions to go from wide to long and back, depending on needs of a modeling function

## Enough chitchat, let's get to it

Several use cases to explore, focusing on working with discrete variables:

- continuous variable but want to turn it into discrete, e.g., binning income levels
    - binary vs. nominal vs. ordinal (or dichotomous vs. polytomous)
    - `ntile()`, `ifelse()`, and `case_when()`
- multi-value discretes as factors - ordered or unordered
- spreading multi-valued discretes into multiple dummies

Here we will:

- Load a dataset built into an R package and inspect it
- Convert some columns into categoricals
- Run a simple linear regression to see how R handles categoricals

```{r}
penguins <- palmerpenguins::penguins ### NOT normal way to load data - usually reading in a CSV

summary(penguins)
glimpse(penguins)
head(penguins)

### Create three categorical columns from existing numerics
peng_cats <- penguins %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  rename(bl = bill_length_mm, bd = bill_depth_mm, fl = flipper_length_mm, bm = body_mass_g) %>%
  mutate(bl_cat = ifelse(bl > 43.92, 'long', 'short')) %>%
  # mutate(bl_cat = ifelse(bl > mean(bl, na.rm = TRUE), 'long', 'short')) %>%
  mutate(bd_cat = case_when(bd < 15.6 ~ 'shallow',
                            bd > 18.7 ~ 'deep',
                            TRUE ~ 'medium')) %>%
  mutate(fl_quartile = ntile(fl, 4),          ### careful of handling NAs!
         fl_quartile = factor(fl_quartile))   ### convert numeric to factor (or character?)
peng_lm <- lm(bm ~ bl + bd_cat + fl_quartile + species, data = peng_cats)

summary(peng_lm) ### note reference values and effect of nonref values
```

How to interpret those coefficients?  (all stats sig, p < .05)

- effect of bill length on mass?
- effect of bill depth category? what is the reference value and why?
- effect of flipper length quartile?  ref value and why?
- effect of species? ref value and why?

In this case, the lm() function takes a categorical variable, assigns one value as dummy (first level if factor OR first alphabetically if character), then auto creates dummies (T/F or 1/0 for each other level/value).

### What if our modeling function required all dummy vars?

We can spread the various values of flipper length quartile (or bill depth category) into individual columns
```{r}
peng_cats2 <- peng_cats %>%
  mutate(bd_val = TRUE) %>%
  ### try this first, note bd_val is consumed; and ask how to improve:
  # pivot_wider(names_from = bd_cat, values_from = bd_val)
  pivot_wider(names_from = bd_cat, values_from = bd_val, 
              values_fill = FALSE, names_prefix = 'bd_') %>%
  ### ask students to do the same with another column -  e.g., species, island, 
  ###   fl_quartile - and maybe use 1/0 or some other fill value
  mutate(fl_val = 1) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = fl_quartile, values_from = fl_val,
              values_fill = 0, names_prefix = 'fl_')
```
